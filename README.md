# SwimTrack: AI-Powered Pool Monitoring

## Overview
Welcome to SwimTrack, where the cutting-edge of AI meets the tranquility of swimming pools. Our project is designed to seamlessly track swimmers using state-of-the-art computer vision technologies. We utilize Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, and BytTrack to not only monitor the number of swimmers but also analyze their swimming patterns and distances.

## Features
- **Swimmer Detection**: Accurately identifies swimmers in various pool settings.
- **Count Tracking**: Keeps a real-time count of swimmers present in the pool.
- **Lap Analysis**: Measures the number of laps completed by each swimmer.
